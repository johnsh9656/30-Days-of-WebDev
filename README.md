# 30 Days of Web Dev

## Info
In this project I make 30 projects over 30 days while trying to learn front-end web development from the very basics. Throughout this project I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vite, Tailwind, Firebase, and more.

This project was extremely valuable to my web development journey, as I learned a lot and constantly pushed myself to improve, in just a relatively short period of time.

While the earlier days contain some projects that are mostly based on tutorials, the projects become more independent and personally driven. I found that working on projects that I have more interest in become the most satisfying and well-done.

## Highlights
Here are some of my highlights from this project, in chronological order:

# Mock Product Page
Created near the beginning of the journey, with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Movie App
Used to learn fetching data from API's and making multi-page websites. Still using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

While learning ReactJS, I used this project to learn more about React hooks and React in general.

# People Cards (Web Components)
After learning ReactJS and more, I returned to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to explore further. I created this page alongside learning about web components, including HTML templates, custom elements, and shadow DOM.

# Responsive Mini-Portfolio
I used this project to learn about responsive web design with CSS, while making a quick "about me" site to look good on a variety of screen sizes (not all included in images).

# Duolingo-Like App
For the final app within this project, I combined and majorly updated multiple Duolingo-like projects along the way to make a fully working Duolingo-like app with React, Vite, and Firebase. This project involved front-end and back-end development, and putting together a lot of what I've learned throughout the 30 days. In the future, I will to update this app in a new repository.
